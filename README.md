## Hi there 👋
I’m Angel, an IT professional and developer based in the US.

I love working with cloud tools to design, implement, and improve IT infrastructure, as well as using code to build fun and cool things on my own.

Outside of VSCode and Azure, you’ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or gaming. I also enjoy playing the guitar and playing volleyball on the weekends with my friends.

Fun Facts:
I am obsessed with coffee. <br>
One Piece is my favorite anime.

Here is what I'm currently working on with Renewal by Andersen of the Carolina's | Follow this link to see the repo: [askRenewal](https://github.com/rbacharlotte/askRenewal)
